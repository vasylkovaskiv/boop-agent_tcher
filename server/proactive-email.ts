export const RUBRIC_PROMPT = `You are deciding whether an email warrants interrupting the user with a proactive Telegram message.

Surface (return important=true) when the email is one of:
- A security-sensitive code or login alert (OTPs, "new sign-in from", password reset, vulnerability disclosure for the user's own infra).
- A time-bound action with a deadline the user has already committed to (rent/bill due with amount + date, contract or document signature, RSVP for an event the user accepted).
- A meeting/scheduling change for a calendar event already on the user's radar.
- A real personal/work message from someone in the user's orbit, where the sender is asking the user a question or expecting a reply AND there's CONCRETE shared context — a specific project, file, calendar event, or thread the user has actively engaged with. Examples: a colleague asking about a file they need, a friend confirming weekend plans, a customer replying on an ongoing support thread.
- A reply on a thread the user is already participating in, where the sender's message ends with a question or pending decision.
- Anything explicitly listed in the user's preferences as "always surface" (preferences override the default rubric).

Drop (return important=false) when the email is:
- Marketing, newsletters, promotional offers, drip campaigns, "early access" / "limited time" pitches.
- Social-platform digests, notification roll-ups, "you have N new things" emails.
- Order confirmations, shipping updates, receipts, invoices, payment notifications that don't require a response.
- Automated alerts from no-reply addresses unless they fall under the security-alert case above.
- Calendar invites the user has already accepted; meeting reminders for events already on their calendar.
- Sender = the user themselves — drop. Match the sender's email against the User identities listed at the bottom of this prompt; if it matches any of them, the email is a self-send / forward from another of the user's own accounts and should drop unless preferences say otherwise.
- Anything the user's preferences explicitly mark as "ignore" or "don't surface".
- **Cold outreach disguised as personal — DROP** even when the email looks conversational:
  - The body offers a service to the user's company (loans, partnerships, ads, guest posts, "would you be interested in...", "we've helped companies like yours", "happy to set up a call", "quick question for you", "saw your work and...").
  - Sender domain looks like a prospecting / lead-gen / agency outreach setup (made-up agency-style domains, *.q@-style suffix patterns, "*partner*", "*marketing*", random newly-registered domains that don't match the sender's claimed company).
  - The body has no concrete shared context — generic ask, no specific project / file / calendar event / prior thread the user actually engaged with.
  - "Re: Fwd: {company-name}" or single-word "Re:" subjects with a fresh sales pitch in the body — reps fake-thread to dodge filters.
  - First-name greeting + a question mark + an offer = template, not a real request.
- **Submissions to the user's own products / SaaS — DROP**. Form submissions, feedback, feature requests, and bug reports landing in the user's product inboxes (UserJot, Canny, Webflow Forms, Formspark, Tally, Typeform, custom contact forms) are routine product feedback. The user reviews them on their own schedule; they don't need a Telegram interrupt for each one. Surface only if the body explicitly indicates an outage, security issue, or named urgent escalation.
- **User-initiated auth flows — DROP**. Magic-link sign-in emails, "click here to verify your sign-in", "your one-time login link", and similar confirmations that the user obviously just triggered themselves by clicking "Sign in" on a service. The OTP / new-sign-in-from-unknown-device case is different — surface those.
- **Expired deadlines — DROP**. Invitations, RSVPs, or time-bound asks where the deadline date has already passed at the moment the email is being classified. Acting on them is no longer possible; surfacing wastes the user's attention.
- **Low-severity automated alerts — DROP** even when they mention "security" or "anomaly". Routine scanner noise — Vercel "1 error anomaly detected, low severity", F5Bot keyword mentions, generic "we noticed unusual activity" emails without a confirmed compromise or required action — should drop. Surface only when the alert names a specific compromise the user must respond to (account takeover, key leak, payee added, OAuth grant, vulnerability requiring patch).

How to tell "real personal/work request" from "cold outreach in a friendly costume":
- Real signals (surface): references something only someone in the user's orbit would know (specific project name, file ID, calendar event, prior thread the user replied to); sender's domain has plausibly appeared in the user's outbox; sender is named in user preferences/memory; the ask is for something the user is already involved in.
- Cold signals (drop): generic offer, no shared context, unfamiliar prospecting domain, "Hi {firstname}" with a sales/partnership ask attached, sender is a name+title combo that reads like an outbound SDR.
- Automated signals (drop unless security/time-bound): from "no-reply"/"notifications"/"alerts"/"team@..." mass addresses, generic salutation, body is templated/HTML-heavy, sender domain matches a known marketing/notification service.
- When in doubt → drop. False positives erode trust faster than missing one notice.

When important=true, write a summary in 1-2 short sentences for a Telegram message:
- Lead with what matters (who is asking what, the deadline, the action).
- Address the user in second person ("you" — in Russian "ты" or "вы"). Never refer to the user in third person, even if their name appears in the email — the user IS the recipient and one of the User identities at the bottom.
- Plain text, no markdown, no signoff.
- Under ~200 chars when possible.
- Write the summary in RUSSIAN. Sender names, email addresses, URLs, and other proper nouns stay in their original form, but the descriptive prose ("X asks you to confirm Y by Friday") is in Russian.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object: {"important": boolean, "summary": "..."} (omit summary when important=false).`;

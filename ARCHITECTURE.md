# Architecture

boop-agent is a small distributed system disguised as a single-server app. Four moving parts, each doing one job.

## The four parts

```

### 1. Interaction agent — `server/interaction-agent.ts`

The front door. One instance per user turn. Its job is to **decide**, not to do.

- Reads the user's message + last 10 turns from Convex.
- Has three tools via two MCP servers it owns:
  - `boop-memory.recall(query)` — pull relevant memories.
  - `boop-memory.write_memory(content, segment, importance, tier?)` — persist a durable fact.
  - `boop-spawn.spawn_agent(task, integrations[], name?)` — kick off an execution agent.
- Its system prompt drills the DISPATCHER rule: answer directly for chit-chat, spawn an agent for real work.
- Replies stream out through Telegram (markdown stripped, chunked to 4000 chars; Telegram caps at 4096).

### 2. Execution agent — `server/execution-agent.ts`

Spawned per task. Ephemeral. One instance, one job, one result.

- Gets the specific `task` the interaction agent wrote (not the raw user message).
- Loads **only** the integrations named in the spawn call.
- System prompt drills: Telegram-friendly output, draft-before-send for any external action.
- Logs every `tool_use`, `tool_result`, and text block to Convex so the debug dashboard can replay it.
- Runs with `permissionMode: bypassPermissions` — the interaction agent is the gatekeeper.
- Returns a string. That string becomes a tool-result back to the interaction agent, which rewrites it in its own voice.

### 3. Memory — `server/memory/`

Three files, three jobs.

**`types.ts`** — shape + defaults.
- Tiers: `short` (decay 5%/day), `long` (2%/day), `permanent` (no decay).
- Segments: `identity`, `preference`, `relationship`, `project`, `knowledge`, `context`.

**`tools.ts`** — the `boop-memory` MCP server. `recall` and `write_memory`. Each call emits a `memoryEvents` row so you can watch it live in the dashboard.

**`extract.ts`** — fires post-turn, **fire-and-forget**. Sends `(userMsg, assistantReply)` to a Haiku/Sonnet pass with an extraction prompt, parses JSON facts, writes each one. The model is told to prefer fewer, higher-quality facts over many trivial ones.

**`clean.ts`** — the memory-cleaning loop. Every 6 hours (configurable):


1. Load active memories.
2. Compute an effective score: `importance × decay × reinforcement`.
   - `decay = max(0, 1 − decayRate × daysSinceAccess)`
   - `reinforcement = 1 + log(1 + accessCount) × 0.1`
3. Below threshold `0.15` → archive. Below `0.05` → prune. Permanent memories are skipped.

This is deliberately simple. Everything sophisticated (consolidation, adversary/judge debates, knowledge graphs, embeddings) was stripped out. Add them back if you need them — the hooks are already in the Convex schema.

### 4. Automations — `server/automations.ts` + `server/automation-tools.ts`

The agent can schedule recurring work from any conversation. When the user says *"every morning at 8 summarize my calendar"*, the interaction agent calls `create_automation(name, cronExpr, task, integrations)`.

How it runs:
- **`server/automations.ts`** starts a 30-second poll (`startAutomationLoop`) when the server boots.
- On each tick it loads enabled automations from Convex, finds ones whose `nextRunAt` is ≤ now, and fires each one in parallel.
- Firing = `spawnExecutionAgent({ task, integrations, conversationId, name: "auto:..." })` — the same sub-agent system the interaction agent uses.
- The result is written as an `automationRun` row, and (if `notifyConversationId` points at a `tg:<chat_id>` conversation) pushed back out via Telegram so the user sees it in their bot chat.
- `nextRunAt` is recomputed with `croner` and stored.

The four MCP tools exposed to the interaction agent (`server/automation-tools.ts`):
- `create_automation(name, schedule, task, integrations, notify?)`
- `list_automations(enabledOnly?)`
- `toggle_automation(id, enabled)`
- `delete_automation(id)`

Schedule is a standard 5-field cron expression. Croner also understands extended syntax (timezones, seconds) if you want to upgrade the tool description.

### 5. Drafts — `server/draft-tools.ts`

Any external action (send email, create event, post Slack message) is staged, not committed, by the execution agent.

- Execution agents only have `save_draft(kind, summary, payload)`. The "real" send tools exist in each integration but the system prompt routes agents through `save_draft` first.
- The interaction agent has `list_drafts`, `send_draft(draftId, integrations)`, `reject_draft(draftId)`.
- `send_draft` spawns a new execution agent with the stored payload as its task. This is the only path to actually committing an action.

You can see every draft (pending, sent, rejected) in the Drafts tab of the debug dashboard, including the raw JSON payload.

### 6. Heartbeat + lifecycle — `server/heartbeat.ts`

Every 60 seconds, scan `executionAgents` with status `running`. Any whose `startedAt` is older than 15 minutes gets marked `failed` and the in-process `AbortController` is triggered if it still exists. This handles both server restarts (controller gone, DB still "running") and genuinely stuck agents.

HTTP routes for the debug dashboard:
- `POST /agents/:id/cancel` — abort an in-flight agent
- `POST /agents/:id/retry` — re-spawn an agent with the same task + integrations

### 7. Consolidation — `server/consolidation.ts`

Runs daily (or on-demand). A two-agent pipeline over the active memory set:

1. **Proposer** receives the full memory list and returns proposals:
   - `merge` — combine several entries into one rewrite
   - `supersede` — newer memory replaces older on a conflicting value
   - `prune` — remove redundant or wrong entries
2. **Judge** approves or rejects each proposal with a rationale.
3. Approved proposals are applied via `supersedes` on `memoryRecords` (which archives the superseded memories automatically in the upsert mutation).

Keeps memory sharper over time instead of noisier. The full run is logged in `consolidationRuns`.

### 8. Integrations — Composio (`server/composio.ts`)

Boop delegates all third-party integrations to [Composio](https://composio.dev/?utm_source=chris&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=collab). One SDK, 1000+ toolkits, hosted auth.

Flow:
1. User clicks **Connect** on a toolkit card in the debug dashboard's Connections tab.
2. Frontend → `POST /composio/toolkits/:slug/authorize` → backend calls `session.authorize(slug)` and returns Composio's hosted `redirectUrl`.
3. Popup opens the redirect URL. User authenticates. Composio stores the tokens on its side.
4. Popup closes → frontend calls `POST /composio/refresh` → backend re-runs `registerComposioToolkits()` which iterates `connectedAccounts.list({ userIds: [boopUserId()] })` and registers each active toolkit as an `IntegrationModule` keyed by its slug.
5. `availableIntegrations()` now includes the new slug, so the dispatcher can spawn a sub-agent with it.

On each spawn, `buildComposioIntegrationModule(slug).createServer()` opens a **fresh toolkit-scoped Composio session**:

```ts
await composio.create(boopUserId(), {
  toolkits: [slug],            // scope — sub-agent only sees this toolkit's tools
  manageConnections: false,    // don't inject auth-management meta-tools
});
```

and returns an `McpSdkServerConfigWithInstance` via `createSdkMcpServer`. The sub-agent never sees the full Composio catalog — only the tools for the toolkits the dispatcher asked for.

HTTP routes (`server/composio-routes.ts`, mounted at `/composio`):
- `GET  /status` — `{ enabled }`.
- `GET  /toolkits` — curated list merged with current connection state.
- `POST /toolkits/:slug/authorize` — returns `{ redirectUrl, connectionId }`.
- `POST /toolkits/:slug/disconnect` — revokes + refreshes registry.
- `POST /refresh` — re-runs the registry loader.

Env:
- `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` — required for integrations. Without it, plain chat + memory + automations still work.
- `COMPOSIO_USER_ID` — optional; defaults to `boop-default` for single-tenant use.

## Data model (Convex)

Seven tables. Read `convex/schema.ts` for the exact shape.

| Table | Role | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `messages` | Telegram + chat transcript | conversationId, role, content, turnId |
| `conversations` | Per-thread metadata | conversationId, messageCount, lastActivityAt |
| `memoryRecords` | The memory store | memoryId, content, tier, segment, importance, decayRate, accessCount, lifecycle, supersedes |
| `executionAgents` | One row per spawned agent | agentId, task, status, tokens, cost |
| `agentLogs` | Per-agent audit trail | agentId, logType, toolName, accounts, content |
| `automations` | Scheduled recurring tasks | automationId, schedule, task, integrations, enabled, nextRunAt |
| `automationRuns` | One row per automation run | runId, automationId, status, result, agentId |
| `drafts` | Staged external actions | draftId, kind, summary, payload, status |
| `consolidationRuns` | History of consolidation passes | runId, proposalsCount, mergedCount, prunedCount |
| `memoryEvents` | Append-only event log for the debug UI | eventType, conversationId, memoryId, data |
| `settings` | Runtime overrides (model, etc.) read by `server/runtime-config.ts` | key, value, updatedAt |

`memoryRecords` also carries a `vectorIndex("by_embedding")` with 1024-dimension vectors filtered by `lifecycle`.

Indexes are tight — search through the schema to see what's supported.

## Message lifecycle

Following a text from Telegram to reply, step by step:

```
1.  grammy receives an Update (long-poll or POST /telegram/webhook)
2.  telegram.ts:  in-memory dedup + chat-id allow-list + (voice→Whisper) → handleUserMessage()
3.  interaction-agent:  save user msg, fetch recent history
4.  interaction-agent:  query Claude with memory + spawn tools
     ↳ may call recall / write_memory
     ↳ may call spawn_agent → execution-agent runs, returns text
5.  interaction-agent:  final text → broadcast + return
6.  telegram.ts:  sendTelegramMessage() chunks + sends
7.  interaction-agent:  save assistant msg to Convex
8.  BACKGROUND: extract.ts pulls durable facts, writes memories
9.  LATER: clean.ts decays scores, archives or prunes
```

Steps 6–7 run in parallel where safe. Step 8 is fire-and-forget — the user never waits on extraction.

---

## Why this shape

**Dispatcher / executor split.** The interaction agent has a tiny toolset and a short prompt so it's cheap, fast, and deterministic. The execution agent gets heavy tools (MCPs) but only runs when needed. Most casual turns never spawn an agent — they complete in one interaction-agent call.

**Memory lives next to execution, not in the model.** Claude has no memory across turns. We re-hydrate the relevant slice every turn via `recall()`. Writing is explicit (`write_memory`) or inferred (`extract.ts`). Nothing is implicit.

**Integrations via Composio.** Tool-calling is what the SDK does best. Composio handles the OAuth, token-refresh, and 1000+ service adapters we'd otherwise hand-roll. Each connected toolkit becomes an MCP server on demand, scoped to just that toolkit so the sub-agent's context stays small.

**Convex for state.** Reactive queries power the debug UI without polling. Durable enough for real use, free tier generous enough for a personal agent.

---

## What's intentionally missing

- **No user auth.** This is a single-user tool. Add Clerk or similar if you want multi-tenant.
- **Single-process scheduler.** The automation loop runs in-process. If you deploy multiple instances, you'll double-fire — add a lock in Convex or run a dedicated scheduler pod.
- **No intelligence runs** (proactive context gathering) — the original had it, it's complex, and it's opinionated about what it watches. Add it if you want.
- **No knowledge graph** — relationships between memories are represented via `supersedes` only, not a full graph.
- **Skills library omitted** — too Boop-specific; write your own prompts/policies in `server/*-agent.ts` system prompts.

All of these are one-file additions. The point of the template is to give you the smallest surface that still actually works.
